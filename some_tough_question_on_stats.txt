6. Given a signal, which is regularly sampled over time and is \noisy", how can the noise
be reduced while minimizing the changes to the original signal? The standard method
is with a Fourier transform. What is the intuition for why it works? Can one optimize
hyperparameters for terms of the transform that sit inside the sum?
 https://exnumerus.blogspot.com/2011/12/how-to-remove-noise-from-signal-using.html
Solution. The simple answer is no. Sine and cosine are periodic, so one can not use convex
optimization techniques.

27. Aaron samples from the Uniform(0,1) distribution. Then Brooke repeatedly samples from
the same distribution until she obtains a number higher than Aaron's. How many samples
is she expected to make?
Solution. Call Aaron's number a (with associated random variable A) and let B be a random
variable that represents Brooke's sample at any given point. We know that P(B < a) = a,
P(B > a) = 1 􀀀 a, and of course P(B = a) = 0, as it is a continuous distribution. We now
nd the conditional expectation from the geometric distribution. Since the probability of
getting a number higher than Aaron's is 1􀀀a, we expect 1
1􀀀a samples. Note that this is the
conditional expectation of the number of samples given the event A = a, not the nal answer.
We now nd the unconditional expectation of the number of samples. To do this, let N be
a random variable that represents the unconditional number of samples before exceeding A.
7
We have calculated E[NjA = a] = 1
1􀀀a . To nd E[N] explicitly, we must invoke the Law of
Iterated Expectation. This can be done by noting E[NjA] = 1
1􀀀A. Thus,
E[N] = E[E[NjA]] = E

Since the function N = 1
1􀀀A = g(A) is monotonically increasing on (0; 1), it has an inverse on

28. You are given n unit vectors in n-dimensional space. Find a vector that forms the same angle

Solution. We rst present a less ecient solution. Consider the (n􀀀1)-sphere that intersects
the end of all of the vectors. Find the center of this sphere and then solve n equations in n
variables.
Now for a more clever solution. Call our desired vector w and the vectors vi for i = 1; : : : ; n.
Note that w  (vi 􀀀 vj) = 0 for all i 6= j. This is because w makes the same angle to all
vi's. Thus, w is orthogonal to span(vi 􀀀 v1) for all 2  i  n. Compute this subspace you
are done, and it can be done in O(n) time with the Gram-Schmidt process to nd a fully
orthogonal vector.

distribution to nd the conditional distribution.

 Largest change of temperature over one day in the US,
 Weight of your phone if it was converted to solid gold,

 Smallest n such that n! has 100 digits,
10
 33:8,
 xx = 1000 estimate x,
 ln(314).
Solution. The majority of these are not intended for one to obtain an exact answer, but for
discussion and mental evaluation. The numerical ones are a bit more interesting.
For exponents, it is generally a good idea to use logarithms and then observe behaviors at
small or large values. For instance, when estimating x = 0:99100, one can perform ln(x) =
100 ln(0:99) = 100 ln(1 􀀀 0:01)  100(􀀀0:01). This is because for small x, ln(1 + x) is very
close to x. Thus, ln(x)  􀀀1 and x  e􀀀1. This is very close to the actual answer.
For the n! problem, the number of base-10 digits of an integer m is blog10(m)c + 1. We are
looking for the smallest n such that blog10(n!)c  99. We can then change our base from 10
to e and use Stirling's approximation to observe the growth of ln(n!).
For 33:8, we will approach the problem two ways. Don't fall into the trap of thinking it is
particularly close to 34, as exponentiation increases the number very quickly.
1) We rst note that 33:8 = 34
30:2 = 34
5 p
3
= 81
5 p
3
. We can estimate fth roots with a derivative
trick. Let y = 5
p
3. Let x be the nearest fth power to 3, so x = 1 and we write y = (1+2)
1
5 .
Here we can consider x = 2 and y = x
1
5 = 1. We are essentially taking the derivative of
y = x
1
5 which is y0 = 5x􀀀4
5 so we can note that y = x
5x
45
= 2
5 = 0:4. Thus, y + y =
1 + 0:4 = 1:4 so 5
p
3  1:4 and 33:8  81
1:4  57:857. However, this is not a good estimate, as
our x is twice as large x itself.
2) Observe the derivative of 3x directly, or 3x ln(3). Our estimate will be 34 􀀀 34 ln(3).
To estimate ln(3), we can use a numerical method (https://math.stackexchange.com/
questions/1179348/estimate-ln3-using-taylor-expansion-up-to-3rd-order) and we
are done. This gives a much better approximation.
We use a similar method for xx. Note that 44 = 256 and 55 = 3125 so 4 < x < 5. Also note
the derivative is xx(ln(x)+1). We essentially wish to solve for x in 44 +44(ln(4)+1)x =
1000. We can estimate ln(4) with the same method as the previous problem and we are done.
For ln(314) we can again use a numerical method to approximate, but for a large number it
can be tedious. Instead, note that ln does not grow particularly fast, and that 73 = 343 is
close to 314. Thus, ln(314)  ln(73) = 3 ln(7). We can then approximate ln(7) much easier.
46. You have $100 and are betting on a fair coin 
ip. You can bet any percentage of the $100.
If you win, you gain 1.2 times your bet (and your bet back), but if you lose, you lose your
bet. What is the optimal bet size to maximize long-run expected earnings?
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly criterion
Solution. We approach this problem analytically. Let f(x; y) represent the maximum ex-
pected money the player can get starting with x red cards and y blue cards. Observing
simpler cases, we can see that f(n; 0) = 2n, as there are no blue cards and the player simply
doubles their money n times. Our goal is to nd a recurrence for f(n;m) with this base case.
For the rst card, the player bets a proportion p of their money on red. p can be negative
and this signies a bet for blue. Then there are two cases: the 
ipped card is either red or
blue.
11
Now let's observe f(n; 1). The prot if red is thus (1 + p)f(n 􀀀 1; 1), as the player wins
and has 1 + p of what the player had before, then the process repeats sans one red card.
The prot if blue is (1 􀀀 p)f(n; 0) since the player gains nothing and the process repeats
sans one blue card. We have f(n; 1) = (1 + p)f(n 􀀀 1; 1) + (1 􀀀 p)f(n; 0) and in general
f(n;m) = (1 + p)f(n 􀀀 1;m) + (1 􀀀 p)f(n;m 􀀀 1).
Plugging in f(n; 0) = 2n, we get that f(n; 1) = 2n+1
n+1 . Note that the proportion p does not
even matter! In fact, the general form is
f(n;m) =
2n+m
􀀀n+m
n
:
Before we prove this, note how interesting it is that p does not matter. The only thing that
matters is that when there is only one color remaining the player bets all their money. In
fact, the other bets the player makes do not matter either.
Observe
􀀀n+m
n

. This is the number of possible orderings of the cards. The term 􀀀2n+m n+m
n

represents picking a random ordering and betting all of the player's money on it at every
stage. If the player wins, they obtain $2n+m and the probability that they win is 􀀀 1 n+m
n
.
Obviously this strategy has high variance, but it can be modied.
The idea arises from observing the original recurrence f(n;m) = (1 + p)f(n 􀀀 1;m) + (1 􀀀
p)f(n;m 􀀀 1). Note that setting p = n􀀀m
m+n gives our desired result of 0 variance, and we can
show that our expected prot stays the same. But this method is not particularly motivated.
Instead, let us change our betting method. Previously we picked a random ordering of cards
and bet on it, but we can also bet on all the ordering of cards equally and simultaneously.
With n red and m blue, n
n+m of the orderings start with red and m
n+m start with blue. Betting
the dierence of n􀀀m
n+m on red every time clearly has 0 variance, as exactly one ordering will
be correct every time. This correct bet will make $2n+m and 􀀀 1 n+m
n
 of your money will be
bet on it. This is exactly the result obtained from the Kelly criterion.
Miscellaneous Statistics Problems
1. X and Y are i.i.d. N(0; 1) random variables. You are given that X > 0 and Y > 0. What
is the probability that Y > X?
Solution. The conditions make this very easy, as by symmetry the answer is simply 1
2 .
2. X and Y are i.i.d. N(0; 1) random variables. What's the probability that Y > 3X?
Solution. Rearrange and see that we want P(Y 􀀀3X > 0). Note that the linear combination
of i.i.d. normal variables is normal, so Y 􀀀 3X  N(0; 10). Thus, the probability is 1
2 by
symmetry.
3. X and Y are i.i.d. N(0; 1) random variables. You are given that Y > 0. What is the
probability that Y > 3X?
Solution. The key is that N(0; 1)2 is cyclically symmetric. When plotting the distributions,
the pdf will be cyclically symmetric about the origin. Then one can perform a geometric
probability calculation to obtain an answer in terms of arctan.

4. How can one use the normal distribution to sample points uniformly from a disk? How can
one use a uniform disk to sample points from a normal distribution?
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller transform
Solution. For the rst part, sample x and y from N(0; 1). The ordered pair (x; y) can then
be normalized. The points are cyclically symmetric, as probability of a point is proportional
to e􀀀x2+y2
2 so for xed x2 + y2 all points should have the same probability. For the second
part, use the Box-Muller transformation.
5. I 
ip 10,000 identical coins and 5200 come up heads. Are my coins fair?
Solution. Another classic hypothesis testing question. Test the null p = 0:5 against the
alternative p > 0:5. Use a binomial distribution calculator or the normal approximation to
nish. The coins have very low probability of being fair.
6. Derive the analytical solution for linear regression  = (XTX)􀀀1XT y.
 https://towardsdatascience.com/analytical-solution-of-linear-regression-a0e870b038d5
Solution. The goal is to minimize the cost function J() = (y􀀀X)T (y􀀀X). Expand and
dierentiate with respect to .
7. I take n samples from a distribution. Why is the canonical best estimator for the mean the
sample mean? Discuss estimators for the variance and standard deviation. What are the
estimators that minimize bias? Are they dierent from the ones that minimize MSE?
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean squared error
 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s correction
Solution. The expected value of the sample mean is the mean. Furthermore, the MSE of the
sample mean is always equal to the variance of the sample mean. Estimators that minimize
bias are often dierent from the ones that minimize MSE. For particular estimators such as
the one given by Bessel's correction, one may need to invoke the Central Limit Theorem.
8. I have three random variables X, Y , and Z with pairwise correlations all equal to r. Whar are
the bounds on r? What are the bounds on corr(X;Z) if corr(X; Y ) = a and corr(Y;Z) = b?
 https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/284877/
correlation-between-three-variables-question
Solution. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can give us the answer with the classic \correlations
are cosines" idea. However, this particular problem can also be solved with the correlation
matrix, as correlation matrices are positive-semidenite. Our particular 3  3 correlation
matrix has 1's along the diagonal and r's everywhere else. The eigenvalues are 􀀀1
2 and 1
which correspond to the minimum and maximum, respectively.
9. Suppose one has two covariance matrices A and B. Is AB also a covariance matrix? What
if AB = BA?
 https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/982797/prove-that-the-product-of-two-
positive-semidenite-and-symmetric-matrices-has-n
13
Solution. The essential argument is that AB must be symmetric for it to be a covariance
matrix. Thus the answer to the rst part is no. AB = BA satises symmetry, so the problem
boils down to whether it is positive-semidenite. One can establish that AB is similar to a
positive semidenite matrix and therefore must be positive semidenite
10. What happens to the coecient of determination (R2) when more independent variables are
added to a regression model?
Solution. Having more covariates will in general give a better t, however, this does not
necessarily mean a better model (in terms of generalization). Thus, model comparison should
be carried out at the end in terms of how the model explains the data (e.g., likelihood, R2,
etc), and how simple the model is (i.e., Occam's razor). Overtting can also be potentially
induced, so one can look at the BIC model selection criterion where having too many variables
is penalized.
